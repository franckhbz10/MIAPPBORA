# Merged requirements for MIAPPBORA backend
# Includes the project backend requirements and the frozen packages from the root venv

# Base backend requirements (canonical list)
-r requirements.txt

# Additional packages captured from the root .venv to avoid losing anything
# Only extras not already present in backend env
-r requirements.root-extras.txt

# Usage:
# 1) Activate backend venv
# 2) pip install -r backend/requirements.merged.txt
# 3) Verify app runs, then you can safely remove the root .venv folder
